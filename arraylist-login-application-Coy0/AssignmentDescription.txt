Login application:

You are to create a program that can store login information. It should also allow users to "login"

Your program needs to do the follow:

Ask the user if they want to "create account" or "login"
If they select create account you should prompt them for a username 
If the username already exists in the system have them re enter a different user name.
After they have a username ask for for a password.
Your program should save this information and go back to asking if they would like to "create an account" or "login"
If they choose to login, ask for a username and password and see if there is an account that matches the credentials.
If it matches, print "welcome, " + username  and close the program
If it does not match print "sorry account does not match records" and return to asking if they would like to "create an account" or "login"

o:Would you like to (create account) or (login)?
i:login				
o:Enter Username:
i:Bob	
o:Enter Password:
